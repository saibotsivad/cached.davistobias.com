<!-- Chapter 1 -->

*The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two yesrs before the earthquake. And he said,*

Yhovah will roar from Zion, and speak his voice from Jerusalem; and the pastures of the shepherds will mourn, and the top of Carmel will wither.

*This is what Yhovah says*: For three transgressions of Damascus, yes, for four, I will not turn away their punishment; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron. But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad. And I will break the bar of Damascus, and cut down the people living in Aven, and the people that lead the tribe of Eden; and the people of Syria will go into captivity to Kir, *says Yhovah*.

*This is what Yhovah says*: For three transgressions of Gaza, yes, for four, I will not turn away their punishment; because they carried away as captives the whole people, to deliver them up to Edom. But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it will devour their palaces. And I will cut off the inhabitant of Ashdod, and the one who leads the tribe of Ashkelon; and I will turn my hand against Ekron; and the remnant of the Philistines will perish, *says Adonay Yhovih*.

*This is what Yhovah says*: For three transgressions of Tyre, yes, for four, I will not turn away their punishment; because they delivered up the whole people to Edom, and did not remember the covenant of brothers. But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, and it will devour their palaces.

*This is what Yhovah says*: For three transgressions of Edom, yes, for four, I will not turn away their punishment; because he pursued his brother with the sword, and he cast off all pity, and his anger did tear apart perpetually, and he kept his wrath for ever. But I will send a fire upon Teman, and it will devour the palaces of Bozrah.

*This is what Yhovah says*: For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, yes, for four, I will not turn away their punishment; because they have ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead, so that they could enlarge their border. But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it will devour their palaces, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind; and their king will go into captivity, he and his princes together, *says Yhovah*.

<!-- Chapter 2 -->

*This is what Yhovah says*: For three transgressions of Moab, yes, for four, I will not turn away their punishment; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime. But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it will devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab will die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet; and I will cut off the judge from their midst, and will slay all their princes with him, *says Yhovah*.

*This is what Yhovah says*: For three transgressions of Judah, yes, for four, I will not turn away their punishment; because they despise the law of Yhovah, and have not kept his required statutes, and their lies, which their fathers walked, have caused them to err. But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem.

Amos 2:7a

This verse originally said:

> they that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor

Many other translations said similarly, but the meaning is not at
all clear, and my knowledge of the original Hebrew is limited enough
that I can't dig in that way.

The simplest translation (Holman Christian) said only:

> they trample the heads of the poor on the dust of the ground

However, another translation (ISV) seems to be more accurate:

> moving quickly to rub the face of the needy in the dirt

Or also (Jubilee 2000):

> desiring that there be dust of the earth upon the head of the poor

Giving an indication that they not only put dust on the head
of the poor, but that they take pleasure in doing so.

Amos 2:7d

The verse originally said:

> to profane my holy name

Different translations, and the Strong's Concordance, seem to
indicate that the profaning is not merely an effect of the
action, but rather that the action is done in a *deliberate*
effort to profane God's name.

Amos 2:8

The word in this case is "elohiym" which may or may not translate
to the God Yhovah. Strong's Concordance indicates it may simply
be a spiritual being, e.g. a "god". Some translations have interpreted
the word as "god" (lesser), but I am inclined to think that, if
the crime were doing so in the house of Yhovah that the verse
would say "inside my house" or similar.

*This is what Yhovah says*: For three transgressions of Israel, yes, for four, I will not turn away their punishment; because they have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes--they take pleasure in putting dust on the head of the poor, and making the roads difficult for the poor; a man and his father have sex with the same girl, deliberately profaning my holy name; they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes of the poor, clothes their debtors put up as collateral; in the temple of their god they drink wine bought with their levied fines.

Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorites before them, whose were tall like the cedars, and strong as the oaks; even so I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath. It was I who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite. And I raised up some of your sons for prophets, and some of your young men for Nazirites. Isn't it true, you children of Israel? *says Yhovah*. But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, telling them, "do not prophesy".

So then, I will press you down, like a cart gets pressed down when it is overloaded with grain. Flight will perish from the swift, the strong will not strengthen his force, the mighty will not be able to deliver himself, the strong archer will not be able to stand, the fastest runner will not be able to deliver himself, the best horseman not be able to deliver himself, and the courageous and mighty ones will run away naked in that day, *says Yhovah*.

<!-- Chapter 3 -->

*Hear this word that Yhovah has spoken against you, you children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying*:

You only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will visit upon you all your iniquities.

Will two walk together, without agreeing on a direction? Will a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey? Will a young lion cry out in his den, if he has taken nothing? Can a bird be caught in a snare upon the earth, if there is no bait set for him? Will the trap spring up from the ground, if there is nothing to spring it? Will the warning trumpet be blown in a city and the people not be afraid? Does evil fall on a city if Yhovah has not planned it?

Surely Adonay Yhovih will do nothing, until he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets. The lion has roared; who will not fear? Adonay Yhovih hath spoken; who will not prophesy?

Place a notice in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, *"Assemble yourselves at the mountains of Samaria, and see what great tumults are there, and what oppressions are in the midst of it."* For they don't know how to do right, *says Yhovah*, the ones who store up violence and robbery in their palaces. *Therefore Adonay Yhovih says*: There will be an adversary, even al over the land; and he will bring down your strength, and your palaces will be plundered. *Yhovah says*: As the shepherd "rescues" out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a small piece of an ear, so also the children of Israel will be "rescued". Those in Samaria with the corner of a bed, and those in Damascus a bit of a couch.

Listen, all of you, and testify against the house of Jacob, *says Adonay Yhovih, the God of armies*. In the day that I visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also visit the altars of Beth-el; and the horns of the altar will be cut off, and fall to the ground. And I will smite the harvest-temple and the fruit-temple; and the temples of ivory will perish, and all these temples will come to an end, *says Yhovah*.

<!-- Chapter 4 -->

Hear this word, you cows of Bashan in the mountain of Samaria, you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy, and say to your husbands, "Bring us drink". *Adonay Yhovih has sworn by his holiness, saying,* the time will come that they will take you away with hooks, and the last ones with fish-hooks. And you will go out through the breached walls, all in a line, and you will given to Harmon, *says Yhovah*.

Come to Beth-el, and transgress; to Gilgal, and multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes every three days; and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of leavened bread, and tell everyone of your freewill-offerings: for this pleases you, you children of Israel, *says Adonay Yhovih*.

I also have given you lack of food in all your cities, and lack of bread in all your towns; but you have not returned to me, *says Yhovah*.

And I also withheld the rain from you, when there were still three months to the harvest; and I made it rain in one city, and made it not rain in another city. One field was rained on, and the field where it didn't rain withered. So two or three cities wandered to one city to drink water, and were not satisfied. Yet you have not returned to me, *says Yhovah*.

I have inflicted you with blight and mildew; the majority of your gardens and your vineyards and your fig-trees and your olive-trees have been devoured by the palmer-worm; still you have not returned to me, *says Yhovah*.

I have sent among you the pestilence like in Egypt: your young men I have slain with the sword, and carried away your horses, and I have your camps to climb into your nostrils, but you have not returned to me, *says Yhovah*.

I have destroyed some of your cities, like Elohiym destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, and those who survived were charred like a stick pulled out of the fire, but you have not returned to me, *says Yhovah*.

Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel; and because I will do this to you, prepare to meet Elohiym, all Israel. Look out! The one that formed the mountains, and creates the wind, and reveals his thoughts to man; the one that makes the morning darkness, and treads up in the high places of the earth--Yhovah, the God of armies, is his name.

<!-- Chapter 5 -->

Hear this word which I speak as a lamentation over you, house of Israel. 2 The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she [a]is cast down upon her land; there is none to raise her up. 3 For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth a hundred shall have ten left, to the house of Israel.

4 For thus saith Jehovah unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live; 5 but seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall [b]come to nought. 6 Seek Jehovah, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it in Beth-el. 7 Ye who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth, 8 seek him that maketh the Pleiades and Orion, and turneth [c]the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night; that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth (Jehovah is his name); 9 that [d]bringeth sudden destruction upon the strong, so that destruction cometh upon the fortress.

10 They hate him that reproveth in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly. 11 Forasmuch therefore as ye trample upon the poor, and take exactions from him of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink the wine thereof. 12 For I know how manifold are your transgressions, and how mighty are your sins—ye that afflict the just, that take a bribe, and that turn aside the needy in the gate from their right. 13 Therefore he that is prudent shall keep silence in such a time; for it is an evil time.

14 Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live; and so Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be with you, as ye say. 15 Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the gate: it may be that Jehovah, the God of hosts, will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.

16 Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, the Lord: Wailing shall be in all the broad ways; and they shall say in all the streets, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, [e]and such as are skilful in lamentation to wailing. 17 And in all vineyards shall be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.

18 Woe unto you that desire the day of Jehovah! Wherefore would ye have the day of Jehovah? It is darkness, and not light. 19 As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; [f]or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. 20 Shall not the day of Jehovah be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?

21 I hate, I despise your feasts, and I [g]will take no delight in your solemn assemblies. 22 Yea, though ye offer me [h]your burnt-offerings and meal-offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the [i]peace-offerings of your fat beasts. 23 Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols. 24 But let justice roll down as waters, and righteousness as a [j]mighty stream.

25 Did ye bring unto me sacrifices and [k]offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? 26 Yea, ye [l]have borne the tabernacle of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves. 27 Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith Jehovah, whose name is the God of hosts.
